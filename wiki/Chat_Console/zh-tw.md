## Extended Chat Console

*[osu!academy](/wiki/Announcements/osu!academy/ "osu!academy") covered this page in [Episode 6 (6:52)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyYRl-a5xII) along with [Multiplayer](/wiki/Multi/ "Multiplayer").*

From most screens in *osu!* you can press `F9` or click the `Online Users` button at the lower right of the Intro Screen to toggle the Extended Chat Console. In addition to the Chat Console, Extended Chat overlays a list of panels in the remaining two thirds of the screen, displaying information on the users currently logged in *osu!*

![Extended chat console](Chat_Console-Extended.png "Extended chat console")

Each user logged in osu has a user panel displayed in Extended Chat. By default, it displays general information (name, total ranked score, rank, accuracy, play count and the user's avatar, if any). When the mouse cursor is placed over it, it displays a different set of information (name, rank, avatar if any, local time, time zone, location by country and, if allowed by the user, city, and what they are doing).

- Friends only limits the display to your friends.
- Lock Panels stops the panels from jumping round this also includes new users.
- Click on a tab to sort user panels according to that attribute.
- Click on the world map to display a world map that shows where everyone is.
- You can click and drag on the white box to scroll, you can also use the mouse wheel.
- Users without stats in their panels are connected to chat using their IRC clients.
