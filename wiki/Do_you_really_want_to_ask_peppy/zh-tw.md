# Do you really want to ask peppy?

Hi there. I ([peppy](/users/2)) understand your urge to want to contact me personally, but I ask that you first understand that this is **not** the place you want to ask me for help/support. I keep osu! support separate from personal messages, and also find that answering forum PMs is quite hard to keep up with. I therefore ask that you do one of the following options:

## Technical Support

Most technical issues can be resolved by searching or posting in the [Tech Support forum](/community/forums/5). There are lots of others there to help you with your issues, so you will find a solution faster than contacting me.

## General osu! support

For account issues, problems with payments, ban follow-ups, enquiries about tournaments and **anything related to needing help on osu!**, please send an email to <accounts@ppy.sh> (account queries) or <osu@ppy.sh> (anything else). If any of our support members are online, you can also use the little "?" button in the bottom-right-hand corner of the page you are viewing.

## Contacting peppy

If you wish to contact peppy personally for non-osu! related reasons, you can email him at <pe@ppy.sh>. Please be aware that any support or account-related requests to this email will be marked as spam.
