osu!catch
===========

_Main page: [Ranking Criteria](/wiki/Ranking_Criteria)_

The **osu!catch Ranking Criteria** is a set of rules and guidelines that apply to the creation of osu!catch-specific difficulties. In order to get a osu!catch-specific difficulty ranked, it is mandatory the creation obeys to the listed criteria. While **all rules must be followed in any circumstance**, guidelines may be violated under exceptional circumstances. These exceptional circumstances must be warranted by an exhaustive explanation as of why the guideline has been violated and why not violating it will interfere with the overall quality of the creation.

Glossary
---------

These terms are frequently appearing when getting in touch with osu!catch difficulties and are also used within the Ranking Criteria.

### Difficulty Names

- ![Easy icon](/wiki/shared/diff/easy-c.png "Easy icon") **Cup**. Easy
- ![Normal icon](/wiki/shared/diff/normal-c.png "Normal icon") **Salad**. Normal
- ![Hard icon](/wiki/shared/diff/hard-c.png "Hard icon") **Platter**. Hard
- ![Insane icon](/wiki/shared/diff/insane-c.png "Insane icon") **Rain**. Insane
- ![Expert icon](/wiki/shared/diff/expert-c.png "Expert icon") **Overdose**. Expert

### Gameplay

- **Fruit:** A large object represented by a hitcircle, slider head, tail or repeat.
- **Drop:** A medium-sized object represented by a slider tick.
- **Droplet:** A small object representing a slider body. Missing these will reduce your accuracy, but unlike the above, will not result in a combo break.
- **Banana:** An object found during spinners. These award bonus points, but do not contribute to accuracy and are not required to obtain max combo.
- **Jump:** A spacing between two objects that requires the use of dash to catch both.
- **Hyperjump:** A more exaggerated spacing which cannot be caught by normal dashing. During play, hyperdash will be triggered between the two objects, characterised by a coloured outline on the first object.
- **Edge Dash:** A very large spacing between two objects where the required Trigger Distance is not reached, and as such, a hyperjump is not generated. The first object must be caught with the edge of the plate in order to catch the second object at all.
- **Trigger distance:** The minimum spacing between two objects at which a hyperdash is generated between them.
- **Antiflow:** A strong direction or velocity change that goes against a player's natural movement pattern.
- **Basic dash/hyperdash:** Any dash or hyperdash whose time between fruits is at least twice the time required to allow dashes or hyperdashes, respectively. As an example, a hyperdash between objects separated by 250 ms in a Platter classifies as a basic hyperdash.
- **Higher snapped dash/hyperdash:** Any dash or hyperdash that doesnâ€™t meet the requirement to be a basic one, i.e. the time between the objects is less than the threshold to be classified as basic.
- **Walk:** Any distance between two objects where no dash is needed to catch both.

Overall
-----------

Overall rules and guidelines apply to every kind of osu!catch difficulty.

### General

#### Rules

- **Your map must theoretically be possible to SS.** This means it must be possible to catch absolutely all fruits, including droplets.
- **Edge dashes must not be used in direct conjunction with hyperjumps.** This is because such patterns require especially precise movement and force an unreasonable restriction on accuracy required to catch them.
- **Each map must use at least two different combo colours which must not blend in with the map's background/storyboard/video.** This is so hit objects are always visible to the player.
- **Do not use keysounds without hitnormal support.** If sounds blend perfectly with the song, feedback for hitting notes is minimal.

#### Guidelines

- **Ensure combos do not reach unreasonable lengths.** Caught fruits will stack up on the plate and can potentially obstruct the player's view. Bear in mind that slider tails, repeats and spinner bananas also count as "fruits". New Combos should be placed regularly to clear the plate and avoid this.
- **Try to have at least one spinner in each difficulty to create variety in the map and fluctuation among scores.** However, if a spinner just doesn't fit anywhere in the song, then there's no need to force one.
- **Overall Difficulty should have the same value as the Approach Rate.** This is just a standardized value, as Overall Difficulty does not affect gameplay nor the amount of fruits a spinner has, just the maximum score of a difficulty. For cases where the two values are not equal, the Overall Difficulty must be less than or equal to the Overall Difficulty of the next hardest difficulty.
- **Hyperdashes may only be used on drops and/or slider repetitions when the slider path is simple and easy-to-follow.** This is to prevent chaotic or unreasonably difficult slider movement, as transitioning into and out of complex slider shapes with hyperdash is usually uncomfortable to play and a major penalty to accuracy for little benefit. Hyperdash on slider repetitions must not be used for more than two repeats, and such slider must not be used consecutively.
- **Use the same slider tick rate on every difficulty** as it is a property of the music rather than the mapping. However, lower difficulties may use lower tick rates to reduce accuracy requirements for newer players, providing they still follow the rhythm of the song. Using high tick rates purely to increase score/combo/difficulty is senseless.
- **Dashes and hyperdashes should not be used when the destination of the hyperjump is located near the left or right border of the play field.** This creates an uncomfortable movement as the catcher is forcibly stopped upon reaching the border of the playfield. Try to leave at least 16 osupixels of space between the end point of the hyperjump and the border of the play field, respectively at x:16 or x:496 at most.
- **Sliderends of extended sliders should be snapped according to the song's beat structure.** If the song is using a straight beat, 1/4, 1/8, and 1/16 should be used. If the song is using a swing beat, 1/6 or 1/12 should be used. If the song has a sound in a different snap from what was recommended, snapping to an actual beat always takes priority.
- **Slider tick rate should be set according to the song.** For example if your song only uses 1/3 snapping, using tick rate 2 or 4 would not be fitting.
- **Avoid using combo colours with ~50 luminosity or lower.** Dark colours impact readability of fruits with low background dim.
- **Avoid using combo colours with ~220 luminosity or higher.** They create bright pulses during Kiai time which can be unpleasant to the eyes.

### Skinning

#### Rules

- **Custom catchers must be included in v2 skin format.** This is to ensure correct display on all skins. The required filenames are `fruit-catcher-idle.png`, `fruit-catcher-kiai.png` and `fruit-catcher-fail.png`.
- **Custom fruits must include all necessary elements and be coloured in a scale of grey colours.** This is to ensure that your images are clearly defined and of acceptable quality. The needed elements can be found at [Skinning/osu!catch](/wiki/Skinning/osu!catch). Additionally, it is recommendable to use transparent elements for the overlays.
- **Skinned elements must be the same size as their default skin counterparts.** This is so they represent the hitbox properly and don't alter gameplay. The current dimensions used in the default skin are 128x128 pixels for the fruits, 82x103 for the drops and 306x320 for the catcher.

#### Guidelines

- **Custom catchers should additionally include the element `lighting.png` to complete the skin set.** This element is however optional to add and has default dimensions of 184x184 pixels, though it may vary depending on the desired visibility of the element.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Difficulty-specific
--------------------

Difficulty-specific rules and guidelines do only apply to the difficulty level they are listed for and therefore do *not apply to **every** osu!catch difficulty*.

### ![Easy icon](/wiki/shared/diff/easy-c.png "Easy icon") Cup

#### Rules

- **Dashes and hyperdashes of any kind are disallowed.** This is to ensure an easy starting experience to beginner players. In order to test that out, it must be possible to achieve an SS rank on the difficulty without making use of the dash key.
- **At least 250 ms must be left between objects and the start and end of spinners to ensure readability.** As an example, a 1/3 gap would be required at 80 bpm, whereas a 1/2 gap would be required at 120 BPM.

#### Guidelines

- Combos should not exceed 8 objects including slider tails and repeats. Spinners are an exception.
- Note density should follow a mostly 1/1 pattern - 1/2 and/or 1/3 patterns can be used sparingly
- Approach Rate / Overall Difficulty should be between 4-6
- HP drain should be 4 or less
- Circle Size should be between 2-3

### ![Normal icon](/wiki/shared/diff/normal-c.png "Normal icon") Salad

#### Rules

- **Hyperdashes of any kind are disallowed.** This is to ensure a manageable step in difficulty for novice players.
- **Dashes may be used if the time between the ticks of the desired snapping is 125ms or higher.** As an example, 1/3 dashes would be allowed at 160 BPM and below, whereas 1/4 dashes would be allowed at 120 BPM and below.
- **Edge dashes must not be used** as they require extremely precise timing which cannot be expected of less-experienced players.
- **Basic dashes can't be used more than two times between consecutive fruits. If higher snapped dashes are used, they must be used singularly (not in conjunction with other dashes).**
- **Dashes of different beat snap (1/2, 1/4, etc.) must not be used between consecutive fruits.**
- **At least 250 ms must be left between objects and the start and end of spinners to ensure readability.** As an example, a 1/3 gap would be required at 80 bpm, whereas a 1/2 gap would be required at 120 BPM.

#### Guidelines

- **All distances should be clear on whether they require the player to walk or dash.** This is to ensure that players can easily recognize patterns that require dashing.
- **Higher snapped dashes should not be followed by antiflow patterns.** If used, the movement after the dash must be walkable.
- Combos should not exceed 10 objects including slider tails and repeats. Spinners are an exception.
- Note density should follow a mostly 1/1 and 1/2 pattern - 1/3 and/or 1/4 patterns can be used sparingly. Individual 1/3 and/or 1/4 patterns must not persist for more than one bar (4 and 5 objects respectively).
- Approach Rate / Overall Difficulty should be between 6-7
- HP drain should be between 4-5
- Circle Size should be between 2.5-3.5

### ![Hard icon](/wiki/shared/diff/hard-c.png "Hard icon") Platter

#### Rules

- **Hyperdashes may be used if the time between the ticks of the desired snapping is 125ms or higher.** As an example, 1/3 hyperdashes would be allowed at 160 BPM and below, whereas 1/4 hyperdashes would be allowed under 120 BPM.
- **Basic hyperdashes can't be used more than two times between consecutive fruits. If higher snapped hyperdashes are used, they must be used singularly (not in conjunction with other hyperdashes or dashes)**
- **Hyperdashes of different beat snap (1/2, 1/4, etc.) must not be used between consecutive fruits.**
- **Basic hyperdashes may be used in conjunction with antiflow patterns. If used, the spacing must not exceed a distance snap of 1.2x the trigger distance and the movement after the hyperdash must be walkable.**
- **Dashes may be used if the time between the ticks of the desired snapping is 62ms or higher.** As an example, 1/6 dashes would be allowed at 160 BPM and below, whereas 1/8 dashes would be allowed at 120 BPM and below.
- **Basic dashes can't be used more than four times between consecutive fruits. Higher snapped dashes can be used up to two times between consecutive fruits, provided there isn't a direction change between them.**
- **Edge dashes must not be used** as they require extremely precise timing which cannot be expected of less-experienced players.
- **At least 125 ms must be left between objects and the start of spinners to ensure readability.** As an example, a 1/4 gap would be required at 120 BPM, whereas a 1/3 gap would be required at 160 BPM.
- **At least 250 ms must be left between objects and the end of spinners to ensure readability.** As an example, a 1/3 gap would be required at 80 bpm, whereas a 1/2 gap would be required at 120 BPM.

#### Guidelines

- **All distances should be clear on whether they require the player to walk or dash.** This is to ensure that players can easily recognize patterns that require dashing.
- **Higher snapped dashes should not be followed by antiflow patterns.** If used, the spacing must not exceed a distance snap of 1.1x the trigger distance and the movement after the dash must be walkable.
- **Strong hyperdashes should not be used.** For basic hyperdashes, a limit of 1.5x above the trigger distance is recommended. For higher snapped hyperdashes, a limit of 1.3x is recommended instead.
- Combos should not exceed 12 objects including slider tails and repeats. Spinners are an exception.
