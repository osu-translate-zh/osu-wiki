# Song Content Rules

*Main page: [Ranking Criteria](/wiki/Ranking_Criteria)*

With a wide variety of music available, most tracks will be fine for use in osu!, providing that they are not:

- Intensely explicit, suggestive, or otherwise extremely confrontational in regards to shocking, obscene or highly sexual content
- Glorifying, promoting or otherwise encouraging suicide, murder, or self-harm
- Promoting racial tension or division
- Extremely and unbearably loud or excessively clipped

Tracks with explicit lyrics can still be used so long as they do not overtly violate the criteria above.

They will need to be identified by a line in the beatmap's description reflecting the sensitive nature of the content. They must also not have the preview point of the map set to a portion of the song that widely broadcasts said explicit content.

## Mapping tracks with explicit lyrics

This is a mildly complicated issue and what is acceptable for one person is often not for another.

To address this, roughly apply a variant of the **20% rule** - is more than 20% of your track's lyrical content a direct reference to something explicit, suggestive, or otherwise controversial?

If you aren't sure on how to proceed with your track given this rough variant, ask any member of the [Quality Assurance Team](https://osu.ppy.sh/groups/7) or [Global Moderation Team](https://osu.ppy.sh/groups/4) *before* uploading your mapset!

Any track that is highly intense or shocking in any manner as described in the three criteria above is not allowed regardless of what percentage of its content falls under the classification.

What determines "highly intense" should be abundantly obvious to a large selection of random people.

## What happens if my track isn't okay?

Any beatmap containing a disallowed track will be removed from the website.

Each time your submission is removed, you will be afforded an explanation by the presiding member of the [Quality Assurance Team](https://osu.ppy.sh/groups/7) or [Global Moderation Team](https://osu.ppy.sh/groups/4) responsible for the removal with reasoning justifying the removal.

You may contest this with them via PM if you so wish, or seek the opinions of others to substantiate your claim to the track's suitability. If you still cannot find common ground on this front, your claim may be escalated to a consensus vote among the current QAT, who will collectively decide if your track is acceptable or not.

All users are given a **one submission leeway** before penalties are handed out due to the uncertain nature of this ruling. After this leeway has passed, users who continually choose to upload inappropriate tracks will face a 42 hour infringement along with the removal of their submission.
