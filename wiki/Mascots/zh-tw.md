#### Biodata

Don is the protagonist of the Taiko no Tatsujin series. He is a taiko drum with a white edge and four legs, a red face (which appears to be moly orange), and a light blue body. Don's dream is to share the beauty of Taiko with the world. Three years have passed since he moved into the Wada House, and he's become quite popular around town. He has a monstrous appetite and sometimes has expensive shopping at the Wada House which may take over for the worst. He usually ends his sentences with "Ta-don", meaning "Ba-dum" in Japanese.
