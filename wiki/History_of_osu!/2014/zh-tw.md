## March

As skinning elements expanded, the element, `playfield.jpg` was removed in it's line of duty and replaced with a new generic one that is unskinnable. `playfield.jpg` was an element that allowed you to use any image as the default background of a beatmap, if one isn't supplied.

## October

As always, many new things were added to osu! One being the new login screen. Another being the new system for scrolling in [mania](/wiki/mania). It was to be based off of the beatmap's bpm rather than a fixed scroll! New intro and outro sequence and an awesome theme song were added into osu!, rather than a random beatmap's music to be played. And many discovered that osu! was pronounced as \\oss!\\, not \\osU!\\.

Lastly, leading to peppy making a tough decision to release *osu!test.exe* (now *osu!cuttingedge*) for **anyone**. This was to allow non-osu!supporters to *debug* osu! Where the newest (or latest) builds of osu! would be updated to any client. That was, if they're wanting to use it's unstable/experimental features. Every function was given in osu!cuttingedge **except** for multiplayer (osu!supporter was required).

## December

"Merry Christmas" as peppy wrote with an update that had snow (current game mode icon) falling in the main screen!
