## January

After a six-month long hiatus, flyte posted on the [osu!next](http://osunext.tumblr.com) blog with some teaser pictures for the next website design. He explained that the current state of the website had many UX problems, from various functionality specs to user feedback, that wasn't considered at the time when designing. Since then, he had been taking some time to redesign the website's redesign from scratch. ([osu!next](http://osunext.tumblr.com/post/169336245023/hi-its-been-6-months-since-my-last-post-rest))

The osu!mania 7K World Cup 2018 registrations opened. ([osu!mania 7K World Cup 2018: Registrations now open!](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2018-01-10-MWC7K-2018-registrations-open))

Community Choice 2017 (previously known as the "Best of" series) voting was opened. ([Community Choice 2017](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2018-01-18-community-choice-2017))

In osu!lazer, background blurring and the hidden mod were added. In osu!web, pagination improvements for beatmap pack listings, hype and nomination counters were visible on the beatmap listings. Obtaining a permalink to beatmap discussion post was now easier to copy, localisations now resize the menu upon hovering over the locales, star ratings can be seen in the beatmap listing via hovering the difficulty icon, and sorting of beatmap discussions were added. A limit to only load 250 forum threads and unload others was implemented to avoid heavy memory consumption. ([dev changelog 20180120 – ppy blog](https://blog.ppy.sh/dev-changelog-20180120/))

[peppy tweeted](https://twitter.com/ppy/status/956058435845611521) that the new t-shirt inventory (along with their new designs) has arrived. Six days later, they were up on the osu!store. ([Dean Herbert on Twitter](https://twitter.com/ppy/status/958185268258865152))

The ability to see star ratings in the osu!direct was backported from osu!lazer. ([Dean Herbert on Twitter](https://twitter.com/ppy/status/958220599783866368)) Lastly, thanks to nekodex, the beatmap leaderboards were revamped. ([ppy/osu-web#2292](https://github.com/ppy/osu-web/pull/2292))

peppy opened a GitHub issue thread to discuss about *passive HP*. ([ppy/osu#1990](https://github.com/ppy/osu/issues/1990))

In osu!lazer, osu!mania scrolling speed was implemented. Thanks to cYsmix, a fresh set of default hit sounds were added. osu!catch's autoplay was fixed to be more human-like. ([dev changelog 20180128 – ppy blog](https://blog.ppy.sh/dev-changelog-20180128/))
