Beatmap Nomination Group
========================

The **Beatmap Nomination Group**, more commonly referred to as the BNG, is a group in charge of [beatmap nomination](/wiki/Submissions/Beatmap_Ranking_Procedure). Individual members are commonly referred to as Beatmap Nominators, or BNs.
This group has undergone many changes recently.
As of 22. August 2014, they are no longer a part of the staff, revoking their chat moderation in-game, red name in-game, and on the forums.
The most recent change was on 01. February 2015 when the team was changed from *Beatmap Appreciation Team* to *Beatmap Nominator Group*.

Roles and Responsibilities
--------------------------

![The Nominator Badge](Nominator.png "The Nominator Badge")

Members of the **Beatmap Nomination Group** are responsible primarily for [modding](/wiki/Modding) the [pending beatmaps](/wiki/Beatmaps) into the ranking cycle.
BNs are the people to go to for any modding or advice requests about anything mapping or modding related.

Becoming a Beatmap Nominator
----------------------------

With the change to the team on 22. August 2014, joining the Beatmap Nomination Group is now a lot easier than it used to be in the past.
The [Quality Assurance Team](https://osu.ppy.sh/g/7) will post an announcement for Beatmap Nominator Sign-ups to the [Pending Beatmaps Subforum](https://osu.ppy.sh/forum/6) in irregular intervals.

### Basic Criteria
Modders that aim to apply to the Beatmap Nominators must fulfill the following criteria:
+ They have been modding beatmaps actively for at least 3 months prior to the announcement.
+ They have accumulated at least 50 [Kudosu](/wiki/Glossary/#kudosu) in total.
+ They provide 3 to 5 of their mods which they think qualify them to be a part of the Beatmap Nominators.

### What Qualifies as a Mod Post
+ Upon signing up you will be asked to provide the total amount of Kudosu as well as the amount of mod posts within the last 3 months, sorted by month upon signing up. So if the announcement is posted in April the mod posts for January, February and March will be relevant. The relevant months will also be listed on the submission form.
+ A mod post qualifies as one if it has received a Kudosu and has been created within the time span listed on the submission form.
+ The gamemode (osu!, osu!mania, osu!catch, osu!taiko) that you modded beatmaps in does not matter as your activity in the modding community as a whole is being measured and not the activity in a certain game mode.
+ The point in time at which the Kudosu has been awarded to you mod post does not matter, the only relevant information about a mod post is its post date and time in UTC+0 as well as the fact that it has been awarded Kudosu.

### How the Required Minimum Score is Calculated
+ This depends on the total `Kudosu Score` and the total `Mod Score` an applicant achieved over the last months. A mathematical formula is used to determine these values.
+ `Kudosu Score` is determined according to the following formula:

![Kudosu Score Formula](/wiki/shared/KDSCORE.png "Kudosu Score Formula")

+ `Mod Score` per month is determined according to the following formula:

![Mod Score Formula](/wiki/shared/MODSCORE.png "Mod Score Formula")

+ In order to determine their `Required Minimum Score`, an applicant needs to summarise their `Kudosu Score` and their `Mod Score` for month one, two and three.
+ The overall minimum threshold is set to the following values:
  + osu!taiko, osu!catch and osu!mania: 1050
  + osu!: 1100
+ It is usually a good idea to keep their socre well above these numbers as they can vary slightly depending on the amount of applicants.
