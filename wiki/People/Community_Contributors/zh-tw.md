# Community Contributors

![Contributor Badge](Contributor_Badge.png "Contributor Badge")

The **Community Contributors** are the people who have taken it upon themselves to provide service to the [*osu!*](/wiki/Glossary/#osu) community at great cost to themselves - tools and features that many of us take for granted today. These users are given a badge to denote that they did something notable for the entire community.

Not to be mistaken as [osu! Alumni](/wiki/People/osu!_Alumni) which are previous osu!team members ([GMT](/wiki/People/Global_Moderation_Team), [QAT](/wiki/People/Quality_Assurance_Team), etc.) that retired, Community Contributor badges are given to public freelancers who had go beyond the call of duty to improve *osu!* and the community environment.

The current users with this badge are noted in this table:
