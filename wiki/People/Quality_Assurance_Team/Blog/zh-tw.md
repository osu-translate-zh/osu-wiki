# Blog

The **[Quality Assurance Team Blog](http://osuqat.tumblr.com)**, commonly referred to as the QAT Blog, is a semi-regular blog written by members of the [Quality Assurance Team](/wiki/People/Quality_Assurance_Team). Since August of 2016, they have been discussing not only the activities of the QAT, but a variety of other topics spanning osu! gameplay, mapping, modding and the game/community as a whole.

Since September of 2017, the "QAT Gazette" series has been posted as [osu!news](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news), rather than posts on the QAT Blog.

If you have an idea for a topic to be discussed in the blog, feel free to contact any member of the QAT!
