# Beatmaps

*Not to be confused with: [Difficulties](/wiki/Difficulties).*

Beatmaps are game levels in [osu!](/wiki/osu!_glossary), like the stages in the [DS games](/wiki/Glossary/#ds-games). In their most basic form, a beatmap have a song and various [hit objects](/wiki/hit_objects) placed according to the rhythm of the music. They can also have a background image, video, and/or [storyboard](/wiki/storyboard).

Beatmaps can be uploaded by the [BSS](/wiki/BSS) (Beatmap Submission System) and are then run through an approval process called [modding](/wiki/modding) in order to maintain the high standards of playability.

You can find beatmaps in the [Beatmaps Listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets) page on osu! web.

## Ranked Statuses

Both ranked and approved beatmaps requires approval from two [Beatmap Nominators](/wiki/Beatmap_Nominators). They can influence the stats on a player's profile which is what makes them different from a [pending](#pending) or [graveyarded](#graveyard) beatmap.

### Ranked

Ranked beatmaps use the double upwards chevron icon (![Double upwards chevron icon](/wiki/shared/status/ranked.png)) in the song select screen.

These beatmaps ideally fulfill all of the [ranking criteria](/wiki/ranking_criteria). This is to ensure that most players can expect a certain kind of standard while playing them.

### Approved

Approved beatmaps use the check icon (![Check icon](/wiki/shared/status/approved.png)) in the song select screen.

The approved status is typically for songs that are over five minutes in length (also known as a [marathon](/wiki/marathon)), measured with the total [drain time](/wiki/drain_time) of a beatmap. Most approved beatmaps do not have an [easy](/wiki/easy) or [normal](/wiki/normal) difficulty. However, some creators may uploaded them as separate beatmapsets with identical songs while some are included inside a ranked song, containing ranked beatmaps.

### Qualified

Qualified beatmaps use the check icon (![Check icon](/wiki/shared/status/qualified.png)) in the song select screen.

These beatmaps are in the last stage of the beatmapping and modding process. Before the beatmap begins playing, a dialoge will display, noting the status of the beatmap will cause:

- No [pp](/wiki/pp) will be awarded.
- All scores will be deleted when the status is changed. 
  - If the status is changed to ranked, approved, or back to pending; all scores will be wiped!

When a beatmap is qualified, it has passed the [ranking criteria](/wiki/ranking_criteria) and has been checked by two [Beatmap Nominators](/wiki/Beatmap_Nominators). Qualified beatmaps is the last line of defense as they are required to be in this status for one week before becoming [ranked](#ranked) or [approved](#approved) permanently.

During the one week duration, however, [QATs](/wiki/QAT) are allowed to write up issues with these beatmaps. If this happens, the beatmapset's status will go back to pending and the process starts over again.

### Loved

Loved beatmaps use the heart icon (![Heart icon](/wiki/shared/status/loved.png)) in the song select screen.

These beatmaps may not meet the [ranking criteria](/wiki/ranking_criteria) but are *loved* by the community and thus are regularly added based on community votes. Before the beatmap begins playing, a dialoge will display, noting the status of the beatmap will cause:

- No [pp](/wiki/pp) will be awarded.
- All scores will be deleted when the creator updates the beatmap.

This status will give those beatmaps a leaderboard.

To get a beatmap in the loved status, see the forum post: [Get your beatmap Loved!](https://osu.ppy.sh/forum/t/549835).

### Pending

*See also: [Beatmap Ranking Procedure](/wiki/Beatmap_Ranking_Procedure)*

Pending beatmaps use the question mark icon (![Question mark icon](/wiki/shared/status/pending.png)) in the song select screen.

A beatmap with a pending status is usually waiting to be [modded](/wiki/modded). [Creators](/wiki/Creators) must seek for [modders](/wiki/modders) from the community and at least two [Beatmap Nominators](/wiki/Beatmap_Nominators) to get their beatmapset out of this status.

Inactive beatmaps that have been in this category for 4 weeks are automatically moved into the [graveyard](#graveyard) status.

All pending beatmaps do not affect user statistics.

### Graveyard

Graveyarded beatmaps use the question mark icon (![Question mark icon](/wiki/shared/status/graveyard.png)) in the song select screen.

These beatmaps were initally [pending](#pending), but are moved to this status because they have not been updated or its thread post was inactive for 4 weeks. These beatmaps cannot be updated until the [mapper](/wiki/mapper) revives it by clicking the `Revive Beatmap` link in their profile, under the category `Beatmaps`.

All graveyarded beatmaps do not affect user statistics.

For the sake of saving digital space for newer beatmaps, *osu!* will purge graveyarded beatmaps if they have been in this status for a long period of time.
