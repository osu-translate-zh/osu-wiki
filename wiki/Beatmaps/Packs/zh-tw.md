# Packs

*Main page: [Beatmaps](/wiki/Beatmaps)*

A beatmaps pack is a `.zip` file containing beatmaps. The name of the pack is based on what they contain (e.g. `Approved Beatmap Pack #7` would only contain [approved](/wiki/approved) beatmaps).

It is worth noting that the most packs are:

- Roughly either ~100MB (Taiko/osu!mania) or ~200MB (-/Approved)
- Contain videos (if included)

## Categories

Beatmaps packs are split into 4 categories:

| Category     | Beatmap types                     |
| ------------ | --------------------------------- |
| Standard     | Ranked or Approved songs          |
| Chart        | Fortnightly Chart challenge songs |
| Theme        | General theme of the songs        |
| Artist/Album | Based on Artist/Album             |

## Fully Completing Your Song List

This is for those who really want to *fully complete your song list* (and not just download your favorite songs).

Keep in mind that you will need quite a lot of digital space to storage these beatmaps. As beatmap packs (and torrents) also downloads with the video and other beatmap skinable elements.

### Beatmap Pack Listing

Download all the (-/Approved/Taiko/osu!mania) beatmaps packs from the **Standard** category and nowhere else. The (-/Approved/Taiko/osu!mania) beatmaps packs will contain all the songs in the other 3 categories.

The beatmaps packs can be found and downloaded from: [osu! Beatmaps Packs page](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/packs).

### Torrenting

> Notice: Beatmap torrents seem to have died off within the osu! community.

  - [HiraOsu! - Torrents](http://osu.hiramiya.me/torrents.htm) by [Hiramiya](https://osu.ppy.sh/u/1313441)

You will need a lot of space (and bandwidth) to torrent all of these packs.
