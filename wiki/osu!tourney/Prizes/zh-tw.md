# Prizes

*Main page: [osu!tourney](/wiki/osu!tourney)*

We may award profile badges to first-place winners of tournaments meeting the following criteria:

- This is the second or further iteration of the tournament.
- The staff members involved in managing the tournament are **not** participating in the tournament themselves.
- The tournament is run four or fewer times per year (seasonal).

Please email tournaments@ppy.sh if your tournament meets this criteria.

If you plan to supply a badge with your request, ensure it is no larger than 86x40 and clearly displays the logo or name of your tournament. It must also be below 50kb in size - the smaller, the better. PNG format is preferable.

## Why does a tournament have to run at least twice or more in order to qualify for profile badges?

The second iteration of a tournament is often free of a lot of the organizational issues of the first tournament, and has established a solid workflow and staff involved in its production. They are far less likely to peter out or be subject to questionable choices. The tournament is also far more identifiable if it runs more than just once.

For all of these reasons (and more), we ask that profile badge prizes are only awarded to tournaments that have successfully run at least once before.

## What is considered 'staff' as far as tournament management goes?

Referees, mappool selectors, judges, team organizers, or any other form of managerial position directly involved in the maintenance and operation of a tournament is considered as part of its staff.

Commentators are not considered by us as staff, and may play or interact in tournaments freely so long as they are not directly involved any managerial aspect of running the tournament.

We have historically had issues where unscrupulous organizers have geared tournaments specifically (ie: picked maps they're familiar with, adjusted seeds/brackets, etc) to farm profile badges for them and their friends. While we understand that most groups will not do this, we must enforce this restriction to keep things fair for everyone.

## Why can't badges be awarded to recurring monthly (or weekly) tournaments?

Flooding the game with profile badges dilutes the prestige of the prize for everybody else. We do not want profile badges to be something that people 'farm' for from a few sets of regular, recurring tournaments.
