# GitHub Desktop

*Main page: [osu!wiki Contribution Guide](/wiki/owcg).*

*This article continues from the main page* and assumes that you will be using [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com). **You may use other git clients on your own terms.** Even if you do work locally, you will still need to access GitHub to create pull requests to make your changes happen.

## Installing GitHub Desktop

1\. Install [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com) if you don't have it installed already.

2\. When the installer is completed, GitHub Desktop will prompt you to login, click `Sign into GitHub.com`.

3\. Fill in the prompts as they appear.

4\. Continue to [Cloning](#cloning).

## Cloning

1\. Click on `Clone a repository`.

2\. This will show a list of your repos; select the `osu-wiki` repo.

3\. Select the clone location. It doesn't matter where you clone the repo to, just remember where you cloned it to.

4\. Click `Clone`. This may take a while depending on your network environment.

5\. Continue to [Branching](#branching).

## Branching

*Note: This is technically optional, but is heavily recommended due to reasons that you will need to look up for yourself.*

1\. Click on the `Current branch` dropdown. This is located at the top of the menu.

2\. Enter a name for this branch. It is suggested to use the name of the article you are editing as the branch name followed by a number. For example, editing the `Forums` article may result in the branch being called `forums1`.

3\. Continue to [Editing](#editing).

## Editing

1\. In the folder you cloned the repo into, navigate to the file you want to edit. The articles are organized by the folder names being the article names and the `.md` files being the locales.

2\. Once you find the correct file, open it using your favorite text editor.

3\. You can now make your changes. When making changes, try to follow the [Article Styling Criteria](/wiki/ASC) as closely as you can.

4\. Continue to [Committing and pushing](#committing-and-pushing).

### Moving existing files

1\. Use Windows Explorer to move files around.

2\. Continue to [Committing and pushing](#committing-and-pushing).

### Creating new files

*Caution: If you are going to create article files using Windows Explorer, make sure the `File name extensions` option is enabled.* See [How to show or hide file name extensions in Windows Explorer](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/865219/how-to-show-or-hide-file-name-extensions-in-windows-explorer) for instructions.

1\. Use Windows Explorer, your favorite image editor, and/or your favorite text editor to create new files. If you are creating new articles or translations, rename the file to follow the [Locales in the Article Styling Criteria](/wiki/ASC/#locales).

2\. Continue to [Committing and pushing](#committing-and-pushing).

### Deleting files

1\. Use Windows Explorer to delete files.

2\. Continue to [Committing and pushing](#committing-and-pushing).

## Committing and pushing

1\. Go back to GitHub Desktop. It should look something similar to this:

![](img/github-desktop-changes.jpg "Your mileage may vary.")

2\. By default, GitHub Desktop will automatically select all of your changes.

3\. It is best to separate each "big" action as a single commit.

For example, as pictured above, [pippi](/wiki/Mascots/#pippi) had added an image file, modified the `en.md` file to add a title and a link to the image, and marked the translations as outdated. From this, we can have two commits, one for the changes that affected the `en.md` file and one for marking the translations as outdated.

4\. Select the files that are going to be committed.

5\. Enter the commit summary. This has a 72 character limit and **must be in English**.

6\. Enter the description. This is optional, doesn't have a character limit, and could be in any language.

7\. Click on the blue `Commit to` button and, and if applicable, restart from step 4 to do the other commits you want to do.

8\. Once you have finished making your commits, click on the `Publish branch` button at the top.

9\. Continue to [Finishing](#finishing).
