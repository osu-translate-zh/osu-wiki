# osu!wiki Contribution Guide

Thanks for your interest in making the osu!wiki better! At this time, contributing to the osu!wiki will require more time and slightly more effort to make your changes actually happen. This quick-start guide is intended for newcomers that have never worked with GitHub and the osu!wiki contribution workflow before. If you already have experience using GitHub, feel free to skip this guide and follow the common feature-branch workflow for content updates in this repository.

If, during any part, you are confused and/or need further help, feel free to send a message to the [osu!dev Discord chat](https://discord.gg/ppy) in the `#osu-wiki` channel.

## Getting started

### Signing up

1\. [Sign up](https://github.com/join) for a GitHub account if you don't have one.

2\. [Log in](https://github.com/login).

3\. Continue to [Forking](#forking).

### Forking

1\. Go to the [`osu-wiki` repo](https://github.com/ppy/osu-wiki).

2\. Click `Fork`.

3\. Click `Fork` again to go to your fork.

4\. Seeing something similar to the image below means you made a fork of `ppy/osu-wiki` repo and that you are on your fork.

5\. Continue to [Syncing your fork](#syncing-your-fork).

### Syncing your fork

1\. Go to your fork of the `osu-wiki` repo.

2\. Above the files, there is some text to tell you if your branch is either "behind", "ahead", or "even" with `ppy:master`. If it says that the branch is either "behind" or "ahead and behind" with any amount of behind-commits, your branch is outdated.

![](img/fork-even.jpg "OK \(No commits and not outdated\)")

![](img/fork-ahead.jpg "OK \(These are your commits\)")

![](img/fork-behind.jpg "Potentially bad \(You branch is outdated\)")

![](img/fork-ahead-behind.jpg "Potentially bad \(You branch is outdated with your commits\)")

3\. This isn't much of a problem; that is, if you aren't going to edit a file that was already changed which may be unlikely the more commits you are behind.

4\. To resolve this, see the [My branch is out of date! section in the Common Issues article](/wiki/owcg/Common_Issues/#my-branch-is-out-of-date!).

5\. When you complete step 4, continue to [Editing online or locally](#editing-online-or-locally).

## Editing online or locally

At this point, you have two choices:

- [GitHub Web Interface](/wiki/owcg/GitHub_Web_Interface) - edit online; this is best for single article edits
- [GitHub Desktop](/wiki/owcg/GitHub_Desktop) - edit locally; this is best for single and/or multi article edits (this includes uploading, deleting, and moving images or files)

*Note: You are not limited to the two choices listed above for editing.* To keep this guide short and simple, these articles will not discuss using other tools in-depth or at all. There are other third party applications that can do more or less than what the GitHub Web Interface and GitHub Desktop already does.

**When you have completed either *GitHub Web Interface* or *GitHub Desktop*, you can continue to the next section.**

## Finishing

### Opening a pull request

3\. If you see it, click on the `Compare & pull request` button (skip to step 8). If not, click the `New pull request` button (continue to step 4).

4\. On the next page, if you see these two buttons as pictured below, click the `compare across forks`.

![](img/compare-across-forks-no.jpg "No good.")

5\. Click on the `head fork` dropdown and select the one with your username (it should be the second one).

6\. Click on the `compare` dropdown and select the one with the branch you had created (these are listed alphabetically).

![](img/compare-branch.jpg)

7\. Click `Create pull request`.

8\. Enter the title in English. The common title naming scheme is the two-lettered language name in square brackets, followed by the article's title. For example, `[FR] BBCode` would mean it is the French version of the BBCode article.

9\. Fill in the description box with the requested information, you can delete sections if they do not apply.

10\. Once you are ready, click `Create pull request`.

11\. See [Reviews](#reviews) and [Merging](#merging) below.

### Reviews

Once you have created your pull request, other osu!wiki editors may review your changes to help catch some mistakes you may have missed. **You will need to keep up with these reviews,** otherwise your pull request may be marked for closure! If you want someone to review your pull request, you can ask other osu!wiki editors in the [osu!dev Discord chat](https://discord.gg/ppy) or in the GitHub comments.

### Merging

For your changes to become appear live on the osu!wiki, your pull request has to be merged. Once your pull request has been reviewed and approved, you can either use the commenting section in GitHub to ask someone to merge it or do the same in the [osu!dev Discord chat](https://discord.gg/ppy). Once it is merged, your changes will take up to five hours to appear live on the osu!wiki.
