# Beatmap Discussion

Beatmap Discussion (introduced as *Modding v2*) is now live!

## Submitting a beatmap for Beatmap Discussion

### New beatmaps

New beatmaps submitted via the Beatmap Submission System will use Beatmap Discussion.

### Old beatmaps

A staff member has to move the beatmap manually to use Beatmap Discussion. [Ephemeral](/users/102335) is currently in charge of transferring beatmapsets. All existing beatmaps in the WIP and pending statuses that do not have any mod posts in the forum have been converted to use Beatmap Discussion.

### Returning to the old modding system

It is no longer possible to return to the old modding system. The only beatmaps that may use the old system are those with mod posts. If beatmaps already use Beatmap Discussion, the forum thread will not have a reply button, instead, it will replaced with a button that redirects to the Beatmap Discussion panel.

## Accessing the Beatmap Discussion page

### Through new.ppy.sh:

Click on the `Discussion` button in the beatmap info page.

### Through osu.ppy.sh:

Clicking on `Modding/Discussion` on the beatmap's page will take you to the page, if it's currently in the Beatmap Discussion system.

## Beatmap Discussion page

### Mode selection

![](img/modes.jpg "Mode selection")

Changes the game mode between osu!standard, osu!taiko, osu!catch, and osu!mania. You can only select each game mode if the beatmapset has a difficulty with said game mode.

## Beatmap page / Difficulty selection

![](img/difficulty-menu.jpg "Difficulty menu")

Clicking on the Artist/Title of the beatmap will take you back to the Beatmap Information page. You can select a difficulty to mod using the dropdown menu. The number that appears besides the difficulty name is the number of pending discussions which have to get resolved. **Make sure you are on the correct difficulty before submitting mods to the beatmap!**

### Modding status

![](img/modding-status.jpg "For your sorting needs")

All of the mods below are for the selected difficulty. Clicking on any of these will show the specific mods in the timeline and in the Discussion section.

- Mine: Mods you have contributed.
- Resolved: Mods the creator has responded to and marked as resolved.
- Pending: Mods that haven't been replied to or marked as resolved.
- Praises: Mods that have been submitted as a praise
- All: Every suggestion, problem, and praise posted on the beatmap's difficulty and the beatmapset's general section.

### Modding timeline

![](img/timeline.jpg "Mod posts, time-stamped")

This displays all of the mods made for said difficulty that has a timestamp. Clicking on these will scroll down to the mod posted at that timestamp.

## Beatmap status

![](img/beatmap-status.jpg "Contains important information!")

### Beatmap creator

This contains the creator who submitted the beatmapset, shows the submission date, and the date the beatmap was last updated.

### Watch/Unwatch

This replaces beatmap subscription. You can track the beatmaps' status and open issues. This page is accessed via the website's Home page by clicking on [`modding watchlist` link](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/watches) located near the top of the page.

### Hype Train

*Note: You now have to click `Hype` to add hype; giving praise will no longer add hype automatically.*

Hype train is similar to the previous star priority system.

> Adding praise will raise this beatmap's hype, making it more visible for nomination and ranking!

<!-- *Note: Players are required to play through a difficulty in the beatmapset in order to add Hype to a beatmap.* -->

Praise must be done in the General `(All Difficulties)` section to add Hype. It will not work through the `General` or the `Timeline` tabs.

### Nomination

Once a beatmap accumulates at lease 5 hype, the beatmap is eligible for nomination. This works as it did with the previous modding system. The beatmap is required to have 2 nominations by the [Beatmap Nominators](/wiki/Beatmap_Nominators) to move into the [qualified](/wiki/qualified) state.

## Mod submission field

![](img/mod-submission-field.jpg "The place where modding magic happens.")

### Mod section submission

This is what section of the beatmap you will be submitting your concerns to.

- `General (all difficulties)`: General issues with the beatmap such as metadata and general discussion on the beatmapset as a whole. You can also add Hype to a beatmap here by posting a comment with Praise.
- `General`: General issues with the difficulty such as beatmap settings and general discussion on the specific difficulty.
- `Timeline`: Issues at certain points in the beatmap. Must contain a timestamp. The majority of mods will end up in this section.
- `History`: Shows when issues were marked as resolved. You can click on any issue to jump to the post.

![](img/history.jpg)

### Modding field

![](img/modding-field.jpg "Where modding magic happens")

This is where you type your mod. If you use the Timeline section, you must include a timestamp in the post. The first timestamp placed will be the timestamp shown in the Discussion section. The General sections do not require timestamps, but may include them.

### Similar post warning

![](img/similar-post-warning.jpg)

If your timestamp submitted through the Timeline section is close to another mod already posted, you will have to confirm that the mod doesn't address the issue you are currently submitting. **Please check the discussion field before checking the box!**

### Mod type

![](img/mod-type.jpg)

This is where you submit your mod. You can choose between `Praise`, `Suggestion`, or `Problem`. Each is fairly self-explanatory. **Clicking on this will submit your mod. If you made any mistake or need to make an edit to your mod, find the post in the Discussion section.** You can add Hype to the beatmap by submitting praise in the `General (All Difficulties)` section.

### Pin

Enabling the pin will allow the [modding field](#modding-field) to scroll with you, once you have scrolled down beyond the modding field.

## Mod Discussion field

![](img/discussions.jpg)

### Functions

- `Sort by`: Sort the posts by either `timeline` (default; ordered on the timestamp given from the mod post) or `last updated` (ordered on when the post itself was posted)
- `Collapse all` and `Expand all` and the up arrow: These will show/hide posts.
- Thumbs Up/Down: Like/Dislike the mod. 
    - Everyone but the mod submitter can give a thumbs up.
    - **Giving a thumbs up will now give the mod submitter [Kudosu!](/wiki/Kudosu!) on suggestions or problems.**
    - Only [BN](/wiki/BN), [QAT](/wiki/QAT), and [GMT](/wiki/GMT) members can give a thumbs down (to deny any Kudosu!).
- Timeline: Shows the timestamp the issue addresses. Only available in the Timeline section.
- CREATOR icon: Displays responses/submissions from the user who made the beatmapset.
- permalink, edit, delete: Permalink grabs a direct link to the post. Edit allows the submitter to edit their submission. Delete allows the submitter to remove their submission.
- `Respond`/`Reply`: Reply to the submission. Pressing `Enter` or clicking `Reply` afterwards will submit your response. 
    - Until you give a thumbs up, this will read `Respond`. After giving a thumbs up, this will read `Reply`.
- `Mark as Resolved`: The creator or the mod poster may select this when the issue has been addressed and either accepted or denied.
- `Reopen a Discussion`: If the submission needs further discussion, the creator or mod submitter may reopen the submission by responding and unchecking Resolved.

## Hype, Nomination, and Kudosu!

### Hype

Hype is used to help push beatmaps forward to nomination; similar to how Star Priority was previously used. Once a beatmapset receives 5 Hype, it becomes eligible for Nomination. Please note the following:

- Each user has a limited supply of hype (5 per week to start). 
    - You will regain a hype 7 days after it was used. <!-- - Hype can only be used after playing through a difficulty from a beatmapset. -->

### Nomination

Nomination is similar to the previous modding system. A beatmap must receive 2 nominations from two [Beatmap Nominators](/wiki/Beatmap_Nominators) before being automatically moved to the qualification stage. Beatmaps must have all suggestions and problems resolved before it can become ranked. BN/QAT can reset nominations by posting a problem in the discussion field.

### Kudosu!

![](img/thumbs.jpg "Thumbs up for Kudosu!")

Giving a thumbs up to a suggestion or problem in the discussion field will give the modder Kudosu!. The amount of thumbs up received determines how much Kudosu! the modder gets. Any user besides the poster can thumbs up any post.

*Note: You are limited to 60 votes per hour, while BN and QAT members do not have this limit.*

Currently, these are the thresholds for earning a certain amount of Kudosu!:

- 1 thumbs up = 1 Kudosu!
- 2 thumbs up = 2 Kudosu!
- 5 thumbs up = 3 Kudosu!

BN, QAT, and GMT members can deny Kudosu! by giving a thumbs down.

## Reminders

- Choose the correct mode and difficulty you wish to mod!
- Select the proper section you are submitting your mod to.
- **Only post one issue at a time.** Do not submit multiple issues in a single post!
- The Timeline section requires at least one timestamp before you can submit your post.
- Check to see if the issue has already been addressed when the similar post warning pops up.
- Do you like the beatmap? Give your hype to help the beatmap move closer to nomination!
- Be sure to vote on suggestions and/or problems, as they now award Kudosu! to modders.

## Tips

- You can filter the mods by using the buttons on the Beatmap Information's Mod Status. You can for example, look at only pending posts.
- You can edit or delete your posts if you submitted a post and found a mistake.
- As the creator, you may reopen any previously resolved issue by responding to the post and unchecking Resolved.
- You can edit your Beatmap description by using the beatmapset's page. Click on the edit icon in the top right of the description field.

## Step by step guide to posting a mod

1. Select the proper game mode at the top of the beatmap's page you wish to mod (osu!standard, osu!taiko, osu!catch, osu!mania)
2. Select the difficulty you wish to mod in the drop down menu. (Easy, Normal, Hard, Insane, etc.)
3. Select the section you wish to post your mod in (`General (all difficulties)`, `General`, or `Timeline`)
4. Type your mod out in the discussion field. Use a timestamp if you are using the Timeline section. **One issue per post!**
5. Select the type of mod you are making (`Praise`, `Suggestion`, or `Problem`)

Your post will be submitted! You can restart at step 3 if you wish to continue modding the same difficulty. Don't forget to Hype the beatmap if you want to help move it forward for nomination.

## FAQ

### Will I be able to mod with the older system after Beatmap Discussion is released?

You should mod with the system the creator has chosen. If they focus on Beatmap Discussion, mod with Beatmap Discussion. Otherwise your mods may go unnoticed.

### I don't like Beatmap Discussion! How do I go back to the older system?

Beatmap Discussion is now live. There is no way to return to the older system; however, pre-Beatmap Discussion beatmaps with mods may still use the previous modding system.
