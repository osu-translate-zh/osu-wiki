BanchoBot is a bot (i.e. a set of commands with automated responses) programmed by **Echo49** that assists people in chat by displaying certain information and announcing game-related messages. It is the host of the [bancho irc](/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat) and has a user profile with the ID *[#3](https://osu.ppy.sh/u/3)* (next to peppy who is [#2](https://osu.ppy.sh/u/2)). *It also has its own [twitter profile](https://twitter.com/banchoboat)!*

<!-- BanchoBot (server) commands start with an exclamation mark! `!`-->

## BanchoBot Commands

To use BanchoBot commands, you must use the `!` prefix everytime. **Normal users can only use these commands in multiplayer channels and in BanchoBot PM.** If a user send a command in public chat, normal users won't see it and they get it as a private message. Users can also use `/bb <command>` client command to automatically open a BanchoBot tab and sending the command immediately.
