===================================

When changing the **title or artist** in a map, a problem may occur in which you may not be able to submit it without making a duplicate map.

**DO NOT SUBMIT IF THE EDITOR "WEB" MENU IS DISABLED. YOUR MAP WILL DUPLICATE.**

To fix a duplicating map, do the following:

Easy Method (don't have any local changes):

1.  Delete local copy of map.
2.  Download copy from osu! website.
3.  Go into editor. Make sure the "Web" menu is enabled (not greyed out).
4.  Change the Artist/Title info.
5. Do **not** exit the editor.
6.  Use `File` > `Open...` to change the Artist/Title in other difficulties.
7.  Full Submit.

Hard Method (keep local changes):

1.  Goto the beatmap info page on the osu! site for your map (http://osu.ppy.sh/b/xxxx -- NOT the forum thread).
2.  Open song setup for each difficulty and set the artist/title back to what is on the website.
3.  Go into Song Select and hit F5. Wait a few seconds.
4.  Go into editor. Make sure the "Web" menu is enabled (not greyed out).
5.  Change the Artist/Title info.
6.  **Do NOT exit the editor.**
7.  Use `File` > `Open...` to change the Artist/Title in other difficulties.
8.  Full Submit.

If you have any duplicated maps, please contact a BAT for resolution.

**Do not submit if the editor "web" menu is disabled. Otherwise, your map will be duplicated.**
