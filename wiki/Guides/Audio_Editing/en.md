[osu!academy](/wiki/Announcements/osu!academy) covered this in [Episode 15: Audio Encoding (4:02)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muu3HkG38kk).
That episode also contains how to install and use Audacity with LAME's `.mp3` export ability.

This article serves as guide to help you do minor edits to your audio files for beatmapping purposes.
By expanding it, you can help fellow beatmappers to create suitable audio files for any need.

_By no means is this the software that you can only use, rather this only lists from those who had added them here._
_If you know of other tools that could be used and can explain how to use them for the descirbed sections below, please add them._
