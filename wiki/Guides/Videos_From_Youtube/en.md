How to download videos from YouTube
-----------------------------------

### YouTube

[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/)

-   It's really an awesome resource. If the song has a music video, it will be on youtube, and probably compressed at that golden point where the video looks decent but won't be a b\*\*\*\* to download.

### Download the video

[VIXY](http://vixy.net/) (there are many, many, MANY more out there but this one is listed).

### Remove audio

### Loading video in osu!

Open your beatmap and press `F2`, click Insert Background Video. Use the slider below to adjust the start time offset and voila, your done.
