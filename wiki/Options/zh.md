# Options

![Options menu](img/options_basic.jpg "Options menu \(sidebar on left\)")

Click `Options`, press `O` in the main menu or press `Ctrl` + `O` in almost any screen to access the options sidebar and change the way *osu!* behaves.

From here, type anywhere to search what you want to change. The searchbar's text will *shake* if your search is invalid and refuse to add in that invalid letter.

When you change a setting that contained a default value, the gray vertical bar on the left will glow yellow. Clicking on this will reset the value back to its default value.

### Renderer

| Name                        | Effect                                                                                                        | Type     | Default    |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- | ---------- |
| `Frame Limiter`             | Change the frame rate limit. See below for details.                                                           | Dropdown | `120fps`   |
| `Show FPS Counter`          | Display the FPS counter. This is seen in the bottom-right corner of the screen.                               | Checkbox | `Disabled` |
| `Compatibility Mode`        | Use the old renderer that *osu!* used before with older operating systems. This will restart your osu!client. | Checkbox | `Disabled` |
| `Reduce dropped frames`     | Adjust graphical settings to decrease dropped/stuttered frames.                                               | Checkbox | `Disabled` |
| `Detect performance issues` | Warn you if another program on your computer may harm your osu!client's performance.                          | Checkbox | `Enabled`  |

* * *

If you open the dropdown list for `Frame Limiter`, you will be presented with these options:

| Name                   | Effect                                                                                      |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `VSync`                | Caps the osu!client to the refresh rate of your monitor. See explanation below for details. |
| `120fps`               | Caps the osu!client to 120fps.                                                              |
| `240fps`               | Caps the osu!client to 240fps.                                                              |
| `Unlimited (gameplay)` | Caps the osu!client to the refresh rate of your monitor. See explanation below for details. |

- `VSync` explanation: In layman terms, using VSync will force the osu!client wait for the entire frame to load before displaying it. 
  - You may want to use this if you see some "tearing" (when the bottom portion of the game is lagging behind the upper portion of the game).
  - Despite what the point above stated, this may cause some lag or slowdowns because the osu!client has to wait for each frame to load.
- `Unlimited (gameplay)` explanation: Unlimited only applies to when you are playing a beatmap. 
  - When you are doing anything but playing a beatmap, `240fps` is used instead.

*Caution to laptop users: using `Unlimited (gameplay)` may cause your laptop to overheat!* Keep in mind that the higher the fps limit is, the more resources your osu!client will consume!

*Note: when the osu!client is not the active window, the fps limit is dropped to 30fps automatically.*

### Build Version

Last but not least, the osu!client build version.

Here, you can see which build version you currently have and which type of build updates you are receiving. Clicking on this will direct you to the Release Notes using your preferred browser.

The builds are versioned using this scheme:

    b{YYYY}{MM}{DD}.{revision}{type}
    

- `{YYYY}` is the build year
- `{MM}` is the build month
- `{DD}` is the build day
- `{revision}` is the build revision 
  - If there is no build revision number, the decimal point will be removed.
- `{type}` is the build type 
  - If there is no build type value, assume it is `Stable`.

## Trivia

- If you type in a name but leave the password form empty, *osu!* will use that name when saving the score locally.
- Opening the options sidebar will automatically trigger `osu! is up-to-date!`'s function (check for updates).
- The `Seasonal backgrounds` option was added after positive feedback was given to the osu!team. 
  - More details: [main menu background changes](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/606931)

### History

- The old options screen was an actual screen that had tabs, buttons, and a dark pale blue background.
- The old options screen also featured a skin selection screen that also allows you to preview live play of a beatmap in osu!standard. 
  - After the options screen was moved over to a sidebar, this screen was still accessible by opening a skin file. 
    - Access to this was later removed after Skin Previews and the Live Preview functions came to be.
