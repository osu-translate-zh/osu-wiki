# BBCode

![The forum post editor with its buttons](img/editor.jpg "The edit box in the forums")

BBCode is a markup syntax that is used in the osu! forums and, to a larger extent, the vast majority of osu! forums on the internet to enable rich text formatting. It is made up of tags that surround the text to enrich and, sometimes, attributes. In the osu!forums, BBCode is used in forum posts, signatures and user pages.

## Notes

While the post editor provides a few basic formatting tools, it is possible to manually write the BBCode. BBCode tags are case insensitive.

### BBCode button behaviour

Without any text highlighted, clicking the button will surround the tags around the text cursor placement in the post editor. With text highlighted in the post editor, clicking the button will surround the tags around the highlighted text.

### Combining tags

Tags can be combined for richer formatting. The order and nesting of the tags **must** be respected when combining the tags. Failure to adhere to the order/nesting may break the post formatting.

For example (pay attention to the order of the code):

- `[centre]` `[b]` *text* `[/b]` `[/centre]` is correct, but
- `[b]` `[centre]` *text* `[/b]` `[/centre]` is wrong.

## List of BBCode tags

### Bold

**Emphasize** words or an entire paragraph in a **heavier way** than [italics](#italic).

*BBCode calls this "Color".*

**Adds colour** to some text.

- Dedicated buttons: N/A

  - The `HEXCODE` argument should not use quotation marks.
- Syntax: 
  - Where `HEXCODE` is a colour in hexadecimal or colour name. 
    - For hexadecimal, it must start with `#`, followed by 6 hexadecimal (0 - 9, A - F) characters.
    - For colour name, it must be a valid html colour.

    [color=HEXCODE] ... [/color]
    

For a list of colour names, see [X11 color names](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X11_color_names#Color_name_chart).

### Font size

    - `50` (tiny)
    - `85` (small)

  - The `NUMBER` argument should not use quotation marks.
- Syntax: 
  - Where `NUMBER` is one of the listed sizes (`50`, `85`, `100`, or `150`).

### Spoiler

*Not to be confused with [Spoilerbox](#spoilerbox).*

**Covers text** with a black background.

This can be useful if you are talking about a critical scene in a TV show, movie, or anime but do not want to spoil it for others. The reader, however, can still read the text by highlighting over the text.

- Dedicated button: N/A
- Notes: 
  - If you use the [colour](#colour) tag along with this, the colour will be used with a black background.
- Syntax:

    [spoiler] ... [/spoiler]
    

### Spoilerbox

*Not to be confused with [Box](#box) or [Spoiler](#spoiler).*

**Hides a paragraph** inside an prenamed box from the reader's view. The reader, however, can still read the paragraph by clicking on the spoilerbox to toggle the hidden paragraph.

- Dedicated button: ![Spoilerbox button](img/spoilerbox.png)
- Notes: 
  - This will create a [Box](#box) with the heading text of `collapsed text`.

    ...
    [/spoilerbox]
    

### Box

*Not to be confused with [Spoilerbox](#spoilerbox).*

These are commonly used to hide large images or a large amount of images.

- Dedicated button: N/A
- Notes: 
  - By default, this will create a box with the no heading text. 
    - If you do leave the `NAME` argument blank (or do not include one), the height of the box will be very small!
  - The `NAME` argument should not use quotation marks.
  - The `NAME` argument can contain spaces.
- Syntax: 
  - Where `NAME` is a name for the box.

    [box=NAME]
    ...
    [/box]
    

### Quote

Quote formatting for the given word/paragraph.

- Dedicated button: N/A
- Notes: 
  - It is nice to note the author of the quote if you are quoting someone (use `NAME` argument).
  - The `NAME` argument **must** use quotation marks.
  - There is a quote button per post (bottom-right corner) that will automatically quote the text of a user. 
    - If you did this, the post (when you click `Post`) will be posted in the current thread.
- Syntax: 
  - Where `NAME` is a name for the box (**must** be wrapped in quotation marks).

    [quote=NAME]
    ...
    [/quote]
    

### Code

Format text with a monospaced font-family and place it inside a gray box. This is useful when you are posting code for a storyboard or source code from a project.

- Dedicated button: N/A
- Notes: 
  - This will preserve white spacing, this means that none of the lines will break unless you break it.
  - Overflowing text lines will enable a horizontal scroll box.

    [code]
    ...
    [/code]
    

### Centre

Centre align a paragraph; this is typically used for titles or headings.

- Dedicated button: N/A

  - The tags **must** be spelt as `centre` not `center` (note the last two letters).
- Syntax:

    [centre]
    ...
    [/centre]
    

### URL

Adds a link.

You do not need to use this tag if you do not want to use link text. The osu!forums will automatically link pasted URLs inside the post.

- Dedicated button: ![URL button](img/url.png)
- Notes: 
  - The `LINK` argument should not use quotation marks.
- Syntax: 
  - Where `LINK` is the url.
  - Where `TEXT` is the link text.

    [url=LINK]TEXT[/url]
    

### Profile

Links a user profile using the user's name.

Usage of this button is **heavily discouraged**! The problem with using this tag is that user names can be changed once after obtaining an [osu!supporter tag](/wiki/osu!supporter). And once they do, the link will fail.

It is recommended to use [URL](#url) instead (using the user's id number).

- Dedicated button: N/A
- Notes: 
  - Not recommended!
  - The `USER` argument has to be defined.
- Syntax: 
  - Where `USER` is the name of the user.

    [profile]USER[/profile]
    

### Google

Automatically links to a Google Search query using the provided text.

- Dedicated button: N/A
- Notes: 
  - Know that this will not give everyone the same results. 
    - Some search results are hidden due to language/location.
- Syntax:

    [google]...[/google]
    

### Lucky

**Add a direct link to a page** using Google's *I'm Feeling Lucky* button using the provided text.

- Dedicated button: N/A
- Notes: 
  - Know that this will not give everyone the same results. 
    - Some search results are hidden due to language/location.

### List

Formats the text into a list.

In BBCode, there are two parts for making the list: the wrapper and the bullets. Where the bullets are placed inside the wrapper.

- Dedicated buttons: 
  - Bulleted list: ![List button](img/list.png)
  - Numbered list: ![Numbered list button](img/list-numbered.png)
  - List bullet: N/A
  - List type: N/A
- Notes: 
  - All bullets must be surrounded by the list/list type tags.
  - These are the valid arguments for `TYPE`: 
    - *(empty)* - bulleted
    - `1` - numbered
    - `a` - lettered (lowercased)
    - `A` - lettered (upper-cased)
    - `i` - roman numeral (lowercased)
    - `I` - roman numeral (upper-cased)
  - By default, bulleted lists uses sqaure bullets.
  - Lists inside lists are known to be buggy.
- Syntax: 
  - Where `TYPE` is one of the listed types above.
  - If `TYPE` is not defined, bullets will be used instead.

    [list=TYPE]
    [*]...
    [/list]
    

### Image

**Show an image from an online image source**.

The images can be sourced from anywhere, as long as the image exists from the given url.

**Do not link the image directly from a local filepath!** Using `C:\Users\Name\Pictures\image.jpg` will **not work**.

Please upload the image to reputable image sharing sites like [imgur](https://imgur.com/ "imgur") or [puush](https://puush.me/ "puush"). Once the image is uploaded successfully, copy and paste the direct link provided in-between the image tags. Also note that some websites don't appreciate direct links to their images (otherwise known as *hotlinks*). Image sharing sites, like the ones listed above, are most likely okay with direct links since they are image sharing sites.

- Dedicated button: ![Image button](img/image.png)
- Notes: 
  - If you have many images or large images, it is recommended to put them inside a [Box](#box).
- Syntax: 
  - Where `LINK` is a direct link to an image.

    [img]LINK[/img]
    

### Youtube

Embeds a YouTube video in your post.

- Dedicated button: N/A
- Notes: 
  - If you have many images or large images, it is recommended to put them inside a [Box](#box).
- Syntax:

## Trivia

- Original forum post: [HOW TO: Forum BBCodes](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/445599) by [Stefan](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/626907)

### History

- There is a colour bug on in the current osu!web forums, if you use the colour `transparent`, it will make the text transparent. 
  - This bug was however, resolved in the new website design.
