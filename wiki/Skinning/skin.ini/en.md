# skin.ini

The `skin.ini` is an initialization file that is found in almost every skin folder.
This file will define how _osu!_ will display certain skin elements.

**Caution:** `skin.ini` commands are case sensitive, make sure you follow the proper spelling and are using the correct capitalisation!

## Versions

Below is the skinning changelog.
The version number, seen in the headings, is what will be used in the `Version` command for the `skin.ini` file.

### 1.0

**Original 2007 - 2013 skin**

If your `skin.ini` does not specify a `Version`, it will default to this version.

- hitcircle numbers are part of hitburst explosions
- large expansion of hitlighting (`lighting.png`)
- old styled spinner (`spinner-circle.png`, `spinner-background.png`, and `spinner-metre.png`)
- segmented countdown image build-up
- smaller selection bar images (87px height max)
- uncolored play-warningarrow during end of breaks
- version exclusive ranking screen buttons (`ranking-replay.png` and `ranking-retry.png`)
- version exclusive sliderpoints display (`sliderpoint10.png` and `sliderpoint30.png`)

### 2.0

**UI: positioning changes / osu!: visibility update (reduced clutter).**

- high definition skins
  - use the suffix `@2x.png` in the skinning element to let osu! know that the skinning element is higher in quality
- new style spinner (`spinner-middle.png`, `spinner-middle2.png`, `spinner-top.png`, `spinner-bottom.png`, and `spinner-glow.png`)
- countdown sequence instead of segmented image
  - countdowns are now centered
- hitcircle numbers are no longer part of hitburst explosions
- red colored play-warningarrow during end of breaks
- smaller expansion of `lighting.png`
- anchor changes of selectionbar images
- positioning changes of ranking screen images (generally, it is shifted down)

### 2.1

**osu!taiko positioning changes**

- `taiko-bar-right.png` and `taiko-bar-right-glow.png` directly sits under `taiko-bar-left.png`
- taiko drum postion changes (allows larger areas)

### 2.2

**interface/UI changes**

- thumbnail support
- changes star rating display to scaling `star.png` instead of partially widthed `star.png`
- panel text alignment optimisations

### 2.3

**osu!catch changes**

- `fruit-ryuuta.png` will no longer work from this point forward
- new catcher images
- new osu!catch specific combobursts (`comboburst-fruits.png`)
  - osu!standard combobursts will no longer be used for osu!catch

### 2.4

**osu!mania stage scaling adjustments**

- downscale combo counter and hitbursts
- column lines are drawn on both sides of the column when columns are spaced
- introduction of hold note tails on release (works for all versions)

### 2.5

**osu!mania column and upscroll adjustments**

- new commands: `KeyFlipWhenUpsideDown` and `NoteFlipWhenUpsideDown`
- new command: `NoteBodyStyle` (stretch, cascade from top, cascade from bottom)
- new commands: `LightingNWidth` and `LightingLWidth`

### latest

**always the newest version**

If your skin folder does not contain a `skin.ini` file, it will default to this version.

- So not use this when trying to distribute skins! (a new skin version could break the skin for what version it was entended for)
- always uses the latest version the game supports

### User

**not a version, but always force [latest](#latest)**

- So not use this method when distribute skins!
- The skin folder **must** be named `User`.
- Use this method if you only want to change a few things (e.g. cursor or numbers, etc).
- Does not require the `skin.ini` file.
- This folder will always force `Version: latest`

## FAQ

### Blank

See this [blank](Blank) for a blank copy of the `skin.ini` file.

### Commenting

*tl;dr use `//`*

To add comments (notes for people to read or code that osu! will ignore), use `//`.
For example:

```
// Like in .osu and .osb files, single-line comments are OK, like this one!
```

### 1's and 0's

*tl;dr `0 = no` and `1 = yes`*

Some commands only accept a boolean value (a `true` or a `false` value).
When skinning, osu! is setup to only recognize a `1` (one) as a `true` while a `0` (zero) as `false`.

Here is a classic example:

| `SliderBallFlip: 0`        | `SliderBallFlip: 1`        |
|:--------------------------:|:--------------------------:|
| ![](Sliderball_flip-0.gif) | ![](Sliderball_flip-1.gif) |

Note that Reisen, the sliderball, does **not** flip when `0` is used.
However, Reisen does flip when a `1` is used.

### Numbers and Integers

The tables below may list either a *number*, an *integer* or a *positive integer*.

When viewing these tables:

- *number* means a **whole** or **decimal** number (e.g. `1.5`, `4.295`, `2`, `3.0`).
- *integer* means **whole** numbers only (e.g. `-13`, `-632`, `135` , `9`).
  - *positive integer* means **positive whole** numbers only (e.g. `376`, `22`, or `5`).
- *comma-split list with positive integers* is-- literally-- a list of positive integers splited with commas (e.g. `1, 2, 3, 55`).

### RGB and RGB(a)

A few commands may ask for a colour in the _RGB_ or _RGB(a)_ format.

- For RGB, the format looks like this `R, G, B` where `R` is red, `G` is green, and `B` is blue.
  - Most commands will only accept _RGB_, without the alpha.
    If you specify an alpha value here, osu! will ignore it.
- For RGB(a), the format looks like this `R, G, B, a`, in addition to above, `a` means alpha (opacity).
  - A few commands accept _RGB(a)_, with the alpha.
    If you don't specify an alpha value, 255 (opaque/not transparent) will be used.

### Sections

osu! organizes the commands with a heading command. Which may look like this `[General]`.
