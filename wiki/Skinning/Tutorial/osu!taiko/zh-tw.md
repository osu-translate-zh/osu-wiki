## Pippidon

The osu!taiko mascot, also known as "pippidon", can be easily animated in similar way as the sliderball.

### Idle

This is when pippidon is waiting you the player to hit a hitobject. The naming scheme starts with `pippidonidle` followed by an indexed number (starts count at zero).

pippidonidle0, pippidonidle1, pippidonidle2, ..., pippidonidleN

### Kiai

This animation plays during kiai time. The naming scheme starts with `pippidonkiai` followed by an indexed number (starts count at zero).

pippidonkiai0, pippidonkiai1, pippidonkiai2, ..., pippidonkiaiN

### Fail

This animation plays when the player misses a note, or has low health during a break. The naming scheme starts with `pippidonfail` followed by an indexed number (starts count at zero).

pippidonfail0, pippidonfail1, pippidonfail2, ..., pippidonfailN

This animation plays when the player reaches a combo milestone. The naming scheme starts with `pippidonclear` followed by an indexed number (starts count at zero).

## Spinners

In osu!taiko, spinners have a warning that moves along the track. The image for this warning is the `spinner-warning.png` image. With `spinner-circle.png` and `spinner-approachcircle.png` being used as the spinner (the same ones from osu!standard).

## Bar (Stage)

### Left

This is the far left portion of the stage. This is where your combos and the drum buttons appear. Assuming pippidon image size is optimal, it is where pippidon would stand (above the drums).

## Hit objects

`Taikohitcircle` and `Taikohitcircleoverlay` - It's almost same thing like hitcircle and hitcircle-overlay with one difference, Taikohitcircleoverlay can be animated.

`Taikobigcircle` and `Taikobigcircleoverlay` - Same as above but it's applied to the big circles.

## Drums

`Taiko-drum-inner` and `Taiko-drum-outer` - Red and Blue button indicators on left taiko bar.

## Hit

`Taiko-hit300`, `Taiko-hit100`, etc. - Same thing as standard hitbursts 300, 100, 50, etc.

<!-- TODO images examples -->

## Roll

`Taiko-roll-end` and `Taiko-roll-middle` - It's taiko slider. Please note that taiko-roll-middle is "copied" to fit length of slider. (That's why it's only 1px width).

## Slider

<!-- TODO images examples -->

`Taiko-slider` and `Taiko-slider-fail` - These are upper part of taiko bar. They aren't restricted by length, so with right idea you can make something nice

### Passing
