## What does the skin.ini do?

The skin.ini file can modify the behaviour of certain skinning elements in a skin.

To create a `skin.ini` create a new textfile and name it `skin.ini` (you need to have the `Show file extensions` options enabled in windows). Make sure that you type everything correctly and use a space `` after every `:`. *Remember, you are not forced to add a value to every command! If you do leave one blank, remove it or comment it by prefixing with `//`.*
