# Skinning Tutorial (osu!catch)

## Fruits

**NOTE: if you choose to leave the fruit transparent, make the overlay transparent (this is because the hyperdash outline uses the outline of the fruit, not overlay)!**

There are four fruits that can be skinned separately. It is sugguested for these to not be coloured in because osu! will tint them with the combo colours.

### Fruit overlays

On top of this (pun intended), here are the overlays. These could be coloured, but should have some transparency.

## Drop

This element is the drop (slidertick) and the droplet (slidertrail) image.

In addition to the fruits you can skin the droplets during sliders as well. Slidertrails (smaller droplets) cannot be skinned, they will be scaled.

## Spinners

This is the newest added skinable element in osu!catch. Named as fruit-bananas but it is actually for the spinners.

## Comboburst

osu!catch now has its own comboburst that ***only*** appear this game mode and did not affect the rest. You can even use different images than in the other modes.

Use this **for skin versions 2.3 and up**.

## Fruit-catcher

The fruit catcher has three states:

- idle (used when a fruit is caught or doing nothing)
- fail (used when the player misses a fruit, overrides kiai if a fruit is missed during kiai time)
- kiai (used during kiai time)

### Fruit-ryuuta

Ryuuta was the previous [mascot](/wiki/Mascots/en.md) for osu!catch, now replaced by Yuzu.

Use this **for skin versions 2.2 and lower**.
