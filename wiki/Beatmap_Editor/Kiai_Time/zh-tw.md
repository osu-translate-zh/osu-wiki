**Kiai Time** is defined by the [mapper](/wiki/Glossary) on a [beatmap](/wiki/Beatmaps) between 2 [Timing Sections](/wiki/Beatmap_Editor/Timing). You can recognize a Kiai time because the screen flashes and you will see a star fountain, afterwards all [Hit Objects](/wiki/Hit_Objects) will flash at the rhythm of the [main beat](/wiki/Beatmap_Editor/Timing) and stars will explode from the cursor when a [Hit Circle](/wiki/Hit_Objects) is hit or will fall from the cursor when you follow a [slider](/wiki/Hit_Objects) or a [spinner](/wiki/Hit_Objects).

## Kiai Time on Beatmapping

The most common term for Kiai Time when [editing](/wiki/Beatmap_Editor) beatmaps is the "strongest part of the song" this is normally the chorus of the song, however some songs don't have a chorus, but they do have a strong part for you that feels cool, so you could insert Kiai Time in that section. Be advised however that spamming kiai start sections will cause a spam in kiai fountains. That is unrankable, and mostly hated by players because of the lag it may cause.

## Things to take into consideration when using Kiai

1. On **[osu!taiko](/wiki/Game_Modes/osu!taiko) maps** Kiai sections give 20% more [score](/wiki/Score), so if you're mapping a osu!taiko specific [map](/wiki/Beatmaps), take into consideration that Kiai does affect gameplay.
2. **Be consistent**; it's annoying when you have 3 Kiai sections in different spots on the same [difficulty](/wiki/Difficulties) and all of them sound different. Additionally, it's good that all difficulties from the same [mapper](/wiki/Glossary) have the exact same Kiai times.
3. **Do not use pure white [combo colour](/wiki/Glossary)** (255,255,255); it makes Kiai blinding and hurts the eyes.
4. It's normal that a Kiai section is slightly more challenging than the rest of the mapset, as Kiai time is also the **strongest part of the map**.
5. **[Guest difficulties](/wiki/Glossary) may have different Kiai**. This is due to the fact that not everyone thinks the same spot is the "cool" spot of the beatmap; however Kiai should still be consistent.
6. Colourhaxing to make Kiai have a different set of [combo colours](/wiki/Glossary) is a nice touch.
