## Creating a storyboard

The [Storyboard Editor](/wiki/Storyboard_Editor) (SBE) is located in the Design Tab (keyboard shortcut F2) in the Beatmap Editor. Fundamentally, the SBE offers users an easy way to control the movement of simple sprites, but is often regarded as clunky and unusable for anything beyond the most basic of storyboards. If one would wish to create a widescreen storyboard, you can do so by going to the song setup dialog.

Users skilled in storyboard creation often use the backend code created by the SBE, entitled [Storyboard Scripting](/wiki/Storyboard_Scripting) (SBS) instead, as it affords them more control. See that article for details.
