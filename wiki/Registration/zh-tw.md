## Logging In to osu!

### osu! executable

![Register.png](Register-3.png)

This executable (which should be named `osu!.exe`) will open the game itself. If updates are required, they will be applied automatically. *Note: You do not need to open osu! as an administrator. If the game requires it, it will prompt for it itself.*

### Options panel

*See also: [Options](/wiki/Options)*

![Login.png](Login.png)

If this is your first time starting *osu!*, you will see this on the left side of your game's screen. Enter your username and password to their respective fields and log in.

### User panel

Once you have entered your username and password correctly, you will see your user panel at the top left of your screen. You are now logged into *osu!* and ready to play! You will also see your user panel on the bottom of your song selection screen, to the right of your `Selection Options` button.
