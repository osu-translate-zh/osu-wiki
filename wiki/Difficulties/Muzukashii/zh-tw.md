# Muzukashii

A **Muzukashii** difficulty is now for those who got used to [osu!taiko](/wiki/Game_Modes/osu!taiko); who know how to handle basic patterns and different spacings. These properties from **Kantan** and **Futsuu** appear in a Muzukashii as well, but in a large amount. - **Patterns can become longer and spacings more infrequent.** Additional to this, a Muzukashii can also provide **short 1/4, 1/3 and 1/6 patterns** which structure is preferable monotonically and short. The rule of thumb is the following one:

- Stick to simple 1/4 patterns like **ddd** / **kkk**, **ddk** / **kkd** but do not overuse them.
- **kdk** / **dkd** are acceptable as long as they're not coupled with triplets of other kinds.
- 1/4 **dd** / **kk** and **dddd** / **kkkk** should be used sparingly and only when it suits the rhythm of the song.
- Same applies for 1/4 **ddddd** / **kkkkk**, but these should stand rather alone.
- 1/6s are in songs of 3/4 signatures or bouncy rhythm allowed, just no suddenly slipping in 1/6s between 1/2 or 1/4 parts.

## Guidelines

This difficulty carries the properties from Kantan and Futsuu in a larger amount and follows the **song itself** in a closer way. Patterns can become longer and spacings more infrequent. While this difficulty works as a bridge to the harder difficulty bracket of Oni, it is still important to have a **good portion of rest moments**, especially when patterns become harder due to possible use of shorter 1/4 or 1/3.

Difficulty setup should include a **high drain rate** and **medium / high hit accuracy** (OD: 5~6).

Try to consider these:

- Use of little slider velocity changes are possible
- Use 1/4 sparingly

And try to avoid these:

- complicated 1/4 patterns
- too long pattern constellations, especially when 1/4 patterns are bounded together with 1/2

## Examples

[Takamitsu Yoko - Angel Dream (Muzukashi) (Ra-s)](http://osu.ppy.sh/b/64427)

- Short 1/2 patterns
- 4/1 spacings
- Appearance of 1/4 leads to **more spacings**.
- Mostly **alone standing** 1/4 5-plet notes.

[Nami Nakagawa - DON'T CUT (Muzukashii) (lepidopodus)](http://osu.ppy.sh/b/67203)

- **Maximum** of three consecutive 1/4 triplets
- Mostly **alone standing** 1/4 5-plet notes.

## Conclusion

It should be noted that the more 1/4 are in use, the more breaks should appear to give the player the possibility to prepare themself for the upcoming patterns. Also keep in mind that a pattern should not be longer than 5 notes and cheap tricks such as sudden increase in scroll speed or excessive large notes should be prevented. And remember: **Less is more**. Try to keep 1/2 patterns small.
