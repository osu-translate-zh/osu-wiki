# Oni

An **Oni** is for experienced players. It is in most cases the last difficulty in [osu!taiko](/wiki/Game_Modes/osu!taiko) which is mostly mapped to a songs significant soundings and contains all the properties from the previous difficulties at once, with the difference, **that the note density is higher**. In that meaning, the usage of longer pattern constellations; more 1/4 notes and for the first time **1/6** is allowed.

## Guidelines

Normally referred as hardest difficulty in a mapset which follows the **essence of a song**. Harder, longer and more complicated pattern structures are encouraged. The use of 1/4, 1/3 and 1/6 patterns becomes more significant in this difficulty. **If your mapset features a Muzukashii and an Inner / Ura make sure your Oni map is a reasonable stepping stone between them.**

Difficulty setup should include a **medium / high drain rate** and **high hit accuracy**(OD: 6~7).

And try to avoid these:

- gimmicks (tricky beats/patterns)
- clustered patterns
- overlaps
- 1/4 finishers if song doesn't call for it

## Conclusion

In general, you are allowed to do whatever you want as long as it is fair to the song, but also here: Less is more. Have some spacings to give players a little rest moment or to emphasize certain parts/patterns.
