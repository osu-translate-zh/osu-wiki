# Ura Oni

**Inner Oni** and **Ura Oni** are just an extra **Oni** and equal to it. In most cases these difficulties are harder as the common Oni and appear when a *osu!taiko-Set* is able to carry a harder difficulty. In such cases, the Ura/Inner is the real "Oni" while the Oni is just a filler for having a better spread. The word *Inner* or *Ura* means "Hidden", which are the Hidden Onis in the arcade game.

## Guidelines

These difficulties are **equal to Oni**, yet, are considered as extra Oni and referred as the **hardest difficulties in a mapset** since they often follow **everything the song provides**. Changes and new trends in mapping will steadily evolve the Inner Oni and Ura Oni tiers of beatmapping. Some gameplay elements or difficulty levels that used to be "unrankable" are more common today. Mappers are constantly experimenting and pushing the limits of the Ranking Criteria as well as the skill levels of the players.

## Examples

[Zeami - Music Revolver (Inner Oni) (KanaRin)](http://osu.ppy.sh/b/162520)

- The Inner Oni is the "real" Oni in this map-set.
- The Oni is only an addition for lower players.

[Hatsune Miku - Hatsune Miku no Shoushitsu -Gekijouban- (Inner Oni) (mint_ong89)](http://osu.ppy.sh/b/158904)

- The Inner Oni is the "real" Oni in this map-set.
- The Oni is only an addition for lower players.

## Conclusion

In general, it is a modified, harder version of Oni. *Not all songs require one.*
